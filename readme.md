# Blurg

Here's a little blog for you.

I've used:

- Laravel 5.3 (I know you said 5.2 but I like 5.3 better)
- PHP 7 (where appropriate)
- Mongo DB (including for users)
- [Laravel MongoDB](https://github.com/jenssegers/laravel-mongodb) (because why reinvent the wheel?)
- The [Clean Blog](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/clean-blog/) template (because it might as well look nice!)

Additionally, I've added Markdown support because what's the point of a blog without Markdown?

It should be fairly standard environment to get it up and running. I've got ahead and committed the `.env` file, just to make it easy.

There's a link in the footer to get to the admin section, and it's open user registration.

Thanks!  
Caleb
